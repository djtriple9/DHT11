# DHTxx
Designed to make use of the DHT11/21/22 sensors for Sense ESP.  Just comment out the sensors you aren't using and and uncomment the one that you are.  Don't forget to set it to the pin you want to use!

Also, please disconnect the sensor from your ESP board during uplad.  failure to so so will get you upload errors and/or corruption.  You have been warned.
